Hence, the aim of this study was to compare the orofacial adverse effects of two recently authorised COVID-19 vaccines, namely BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. Methods: Publicly available data on BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines were accessed from the relevant regulatory authorities in the United States, Canada, European Union and United Kingdom. Both patient/recipient information and healthcare professional fact sheets for each of these drugs were manually searched to find their orofacial adverse effects. Results: Adverse events affecting the orofacial region were reported for both vaccines. These were rare and included acute peripheral facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), facial swelling, and swelling of the lips, face or tongue associated with anaphylaxis. There was heterogeneity in the acknowledgement of vaccine-related adverse events in North America compared with Europe. Conclusion: Globally, there are inconsistencies in the description of adverse effects presenting in the orofacial region of the COVID-19 vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. We believe that awareness of these orofacial manifestations will improve recognition, management and reporting of vaccine-related adverse effects."

        "context": "Background: Following the emergency use authorisation of the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (international non-proprietary name tozinameran) in Israel, the Ministry of Health (MoH) launched a campaign to immunise the 6{\\textperiodcentered}5 million residents of Israel aged 16 years and older. We estimated the real-world effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2 against a range of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes and to evaluate the nationwide public-health impact following the widespread introduction of the vaccine. Methods: We used national surveillance data from the first 4 months of the nationwide vaccination campaign to ascertain incident cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and outcomes, as well as vaccine uptake in residents of Israel aged 16 years and older. Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 outcomes (asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and COVID-19-related hospitalisation, severe or critical hospitalisation, and death) was calculated on the basis of incidence rates in fully vaccinated individuals (defined as those for whom 7 days had passed since receiving the second dose of vaccine) compared with rates in unvaccinated individuals (who had not received any doses of the vaccine), with use of a negative binomial regression model adjusted for age group (16\u201324, 25\u201334, 35\u201344, 45\u201354, 55\u201364, 65\u201374, 75\u201384, and \u226585 years), sex, and calendar week. The proportion of spike gene target failures on PCR test among a nationwide convenience-sample of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens was used to estimate the prevelance of the B.1.1.7 variant. Findings: During the analysis period (Jan 24 to April 3, 2021), there were 232 268 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 7694 COVID-19 hospitalisations, 4481 severe or critical COVID-19 hospitalisations, and 1113 COVID-19 deaths in people aged 16 years or older. By April 3, 2021, 4 714 932 (72{\\textperiodcentered}1%) of 6 538 911 people aged 16 years and older were fully vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2.

In all age groups, as vaccine coverage increased, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes declined. 8006 of 8472 samples tested showed a spike gene target failure, giving an estimated prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant of 94{\\textperiodcentered}5% among SARS-CoV-2 infections. Interpretation: Two doses of BNT162b2 are highly effective across all age groups (\u226516 years, including older adults aged \u226585 years) in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospitalisations, severe disease, and death, including those caused by the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. There were marked and sustained declines in SARS-CoV-2 incidence corresponding to increasing vaccine coverage. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination can help to control the pandemic.

Methods Established patients at NYU Langone Health with IMID (n=51) receiving the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination were assessed at baseline and after second immunization. Healthy subjects served as controls (n=26). IgG antibody responses to the spike protein were analyzed for humoral response. Cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 was further analyzed using high-parameter spectral flow cytometry. A second independent, validation cohort of controls (n=182) and patients with IMID (n=31) from Erlangen, Germany were also analyzed for humoral immune response. Results Although healthy subjects (n=208) and IMID patients on biologic treatments (mostly on TNF blockers, n=37) demonstrate robust antibody responses (over 90%), those patients with IMID on background methotrexate (n=45) achieve an adequate response in only 62.2% of cases.Similarly, IMID patients do not demonstrate an increase in CD8+ T cell activation after vaccination. Conclusions In two independent cohorts of IMID patients, methotrexate, a widely used immunomodulator for the treatment of several IMIDs, adversely affected humoral and cellular immune response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Although precise cut offs for immunogenicity that correlate with vaccine efficacy are yet to be established, our findings suggest that different strategies may need to be explored in patients with IMID taking methotrexate to increase the chances of immunization efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 as has been demonstrated for augmenting immunogenicity to other viral vaccines."

A lower proportion of patients were seropositive following vaccination (75%) than in a comparison group (99%; p\u00a0< 0.001), and median (interquartile range [IQR]) antibody titers in patients were lower (90 [12.4\u2013185.5] and 173 [133\u2013232] AU/ml, respectively; p\u00a0< 0.001). Older age, higher lactate dehydrogenase, and number of treatment lines correlated with lower seropositivity likelihood and antibody titers, while absolute lymphocyte count, globulin level, and time from last treatment to vaccination correlated with higher seropositivity likelihood and antibody titers. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients had the lowest seropositivity rate followed by indolent lymphoma. Patients recently treated with chemo-immunotherapy, anti-CD20 antibodies, BCL2, BTK or JAK2 inhibitors had significantly less seropositive responses and lower median (IQR) antibody titers (29%, 1.9 [1.9\u201312] AU/ml; 0%, 1.9 [1.9\u20131.9] AU/ml; 25%, 1.9 [1.9\u201325] AU/ml; 40%, 1.9 [1.9\u201392.8] AU/ml; and 42%, 10.9 [5.7\u201366.4] AU/ml, respectively; p\u00a0< 0.001).

However, the effect of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) on the efficacy to mount an appropriate immune response is unknown. We aimed to characterize humoral immunity in mRNA-COVID-19 MS vaccinees treated with high-efficacy DMTs. Methods: We measured SARS-CoV-2 IgG response using anti-spike protein-based serology (EUROIMMUN) in 125 MS patients vaccinated with BNT162b2-COVID-19 vaccine 1 month after the second dose. Patients were either untreated or under treatment with fingolimod, cladribine, or ocrelizumab. A group of healthy subjects similarly vaccinated served as control. The percent of subjects that developed protective antibodies, the titer, and the time from the last dosing were evaluated. Results: Protective humoral immunity of 97.9%, 100%, 100%, 22.7%, and 3.8%, was observed in COVID-19 vaccinated healthy subjects (N = 47), untreated MS patients (N = 32), and MS patients treated with cladribine (N = 23), ocrelizumab (N = 44), and fingolimod (N = 26), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titer was high in healthy subjects, untreated MS patients, and MS patients under cladribine treatment, within 29.5\u201355 days after the second vaccine dose. Only 22.7% of patients treated with ocrelizumab developed humoral IgG response irrespective to normal absolute lymphocyte count. Most fingolimod-treated MS patients had very low lymphocyte count and failed to develop SARS-COV-2 antibodies. Age, disease duration, and time from the last dosing did not affect humoral response to COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions: Cladribine treatment does not impair humoral response to COVID-19 vaccination. We recommend postponing ocrelizumab treatment in MS patients willing to be vaccinated as a protective humoral response can be expected only in some. We do not recommend vaccinating MS patients treated with fingolimod as a protective humoral response is not expected."

The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines against this variant has been unclear. METHODS We used a test-negative case\u2013control design to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant or the predominant strain (B.1.1.7, or alpha variant) over the period that the delta variant began circulating. Variants were identified with the use of sequencing and on the basis of the spike (S) gene status. Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of Covid-19 in England were used to estimate the proportion of cases with either variant according to the patients\u2019 vaccination status. RESULTS Effectiveness after one dose of vaccine (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) was notably lower among persons with the delta variant (30.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.2 to 35.7) than among those with the alpha variant (48.7%; 95% CI, 45.5 to 51.7); the results were similar for both vaccines. With the BNT162b2 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 to 95.3) among persons with the alpha variant and 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 to 90.1) among those with the delta variant. With the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 74.5% (95% CI, 68.4 to 79.4) among persons with the alpha variant and 67.0% (95% CI, 61.3 to 71.8) among those with the delta variant."

The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines against this variant has been unclear. METHODS We used a test-negative case\u2013control design to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant or the predominant strain (B.1.1.7, or alpha variant) over the period that the delta variant began circulating. Variants were identified with the use of sequencing and on the basis of the spike (S) gene status. Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of Covid-19 in England were used to estimate the proportion of cases with either variant according to the patients\u2019 vaccination status. RESULTS Effectiveness after one dose of vaccine (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) was notably lower among persons with the delta variant (30.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.2 to 35.7) than among those with the alpha variant (48.7%; 95% CI, 45.5 to 51.7); the results were similar for both vaccines. With the BNT162b2 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 to 95.3) among persons with the alpha variant and 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 to 90.1) among those with the delta variant.

        "context": "The BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) is being utilised internationally for mass COVID-19 vaccination. Evidence of single-dose protection against symptomatic disease has encouraged some countries to opt for delayed booster doses of BNT162b2, but the effect of this strategy on rates of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. We previously demonstrated frequent pauci-and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst healthcare workers (HCWs) during the UK's first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, using a comprehensive PCR-based HCW screening programme (Rivett et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2020). Here, we evaluate the effect of first-dose BNT162b2 vaccination on test positivity rates and find a fourfold reduction in asymptomatic infection amongst HCWs 12 days post-vaccination. These data provide real-world evidence of short-term protection against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection following a single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, suggesting that mass first-dose vaccination will reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as well as the burden of COVID-19 disease."

Here, we report preliminary results on the efficacy and safety of Gam-COVID-Vac from the interim analysis of this phase 3 trial. Methods: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 25 hospitals and polyclinics in Moscow, Russia. We included participants aged at least 18 years, with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and IgG and IgM tests, no infectious diseases in the 14 days before enrolment, and no other vaccinations in the 30 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo, with stratification by age group. Investigators, participants, and all study staff were masked to group assignment. The vaccine was administered (0{\\textperiodcentered}5 mL/dose) intramuscularly in a prime-boost regimen: a 21-day interval between the first dose (rAd26) and the second dose (rAd5), both vectors carrying the gene for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from day 21 after receiving the first dose. All analyses excluded participants with protocol violations: the primary outcome was assessed in participants who had received two doses of vaccine or placebo, serious adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received at least one dose at the time of database lock, and rare adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received two doses and for whom all available data were verified in the case report form at the time of database lock. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04530396). Findings: Between Sept 7 and Nov 24, 2020, 21 977 adults were randomly assigned to the vaccine group (n=16 501) or the placebo group (n=5476). 19 866 received two doses of vaccine or placebo and were included in the primary outcome analysis. From 21 days after the first dose of vaccine (the day of dose 2), 16 (0{\\textperiodcentered}1%) of 14 964 participants in the vaccine group and 62 (1{\\textperiodcentered}3%) of 4902 in the placebo group were confirmed to have COVID-19; vaccine efficacy was 91{\\textperiodcentered}6% (95% CI 85{\\textperiodcentered}6\u201395{\\textperiodcentered}2). Most reported adverse events were grade 1 (7485 [94{\\textperiodcentered}0%] of 7966 total events). 45 (0{\\textperiodcentered}3%) of 16 427 participants in the vaccine group and 23 (0{\\textperiodcentered}4%) of 5435 participants in the placebo group had serious adverse events; none were considered associated with vaccination, with confirmation from the independent data monitoring committee. Four deaths were reported during the study (three [<0{\\textperiodcentered}1%] of 16 427 participants in the vaccine group and one [<0{\\textperiodcentered}1%] of 5435 participants in the placebo group), none of which were considered related to the vaccine. Interpretation: This interim analysis of the phase 3 trial of Gam-COVID-Vac showed 91{\\textperiodcentered}6% efficacy against COVID-19 and was well tolerated in a large cohort.

On December 18, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Moderna COVID-19 vaccine administered as 2 doses, 1 month apart to prevent COVID-19. On December 19, 2020, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued an interim recommendation for use of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (1). As of January 10, 2021, a reported 4,041,396 first doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine had been administered in the United States, and reports of 1,266 (0.03%) adverse events after receipt of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine were submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Among these, 108 case reports were identified for further review as possible cases of severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rarely after vaccination, with onset typically within minutes to hours (2). Among these case reports, 10 cases were determined to be anaphylaxis (a rate of 2.5 anaphylaxis cases per million Moderna COVID-19 vaccine doses administered), including nine in persons with a documented history of allergies or allergic reactions, five of whom had a previous history of anaphylaxis. The median interval from vaccine receipt to symptom onset was 7.5 minutes (range\u00a0=\u00a01-45 minutes). Among eight persons with follow-up information available, all had recovered or been discharged home. Among the remaining case reports that were determined not to be anaphylaxis, 47 were assessed to be nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, and 47 were considered nonallergic adverse events. For four case reports, investigators have been unable to obtain sufficient information to assess the likelihood of anaphylaxis. This report summarizes the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of case reports of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, after receipt of the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine during December 21, 2020-January 10, 2021, in the United States.

Although complete vaccination consisted of two-doses, the onset of protection for both licensed RNA vaccines was observed as early as 12 days after a single dose. The adaptive immune response that coincides with this onset of protection could represent the necessary elements of immunity against Covid-19. Methods Serological and T cell analysis was performed in a cohort of 20 healthcare workers after receiving the first dose of Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine. The primary endpoint was the adaptive immune responses detectable at Days 7 and 10 after dosing. Results Spike-specific T cells and binding antibodies were detectable 10 days after the first dose of vaccine, in contrast to receptor-blocking and SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies which were mostly undetectable at this early time-point. Conclusions Our findings suggest that early T cell and binding antibody responses, rather than either receptor-blocking or virus neutralizing activity, induced early protection against Covid-19.

The public health emergency required urgent efforts to develop and test the efficacy and safety of vaccines to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergency use approval has been granted to COVID-19 vaccines before the completion of conventional phases of clinical trials. However, there is no comprehensive review of safety data reported from the vaccine trials, which is critical information to inform the policies in order to improve uptake of COVID-19 vaccines and mitigate the risk aversion perceived due to the COVID-vaccine side effects. This study aims to systematically review and synthesize the evidence on the safety data from the published COVID-19 vaccine trials. This study followed PRISMA guidelines. We searched three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar) for published studies between Dec 2019 and 2020. Eligible study designs were randomized trials and pre-and post-intervention evaluations. Descriptive findings of included studies were reported stratified by target population, setting, outcomes, and overall results. From PubMed, Embase, WHO database, and Google Scholar screened titles and abstracts, 11 studies were identified in this review. Most of the reactions reported were mild to moderate whereas a few with severe intensity. All reactions resolved within 3\u20134\u00a0days. The commonly reported local adverse events were pain at the site of injection, swelling, and redness. The systemic reactions included fever, fatigue, myalgia, and headache. Some trials also reported laboratory derangements like decreased hemoglobin, increased bilirubin, altered SGOT and SGPT. None of these alterations were clinically manifested and were self-limiting. Few clinical trials reported serious adverse events, but they were unrelated to vaccination. This systematic review indicates that COVID-19 vaccines can be safe with no serious adverse events. However, long-term post-marketing surveillance data, particularly in high-risk vulnerable populations (elderly and those with co-morbidities, pregnant women, and children) is warranted to ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines."

        "context": "Objective: To assess antibody response to inactivated COVID-19 vaccine in patients with immune-mediated diseases (IMD) among hospital workers and people aged 65 and older. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we studied 82 hospital workers with IMD (mean age: 42.2 \u00b1 10.0\u00a0years) and 300 (mean age: 41.7 \u00b1 9.9\u00a0years) controls. Among + 65 aged population, we studied 22 (mean age: 71.4 \u00b1 4.5\u00a0years) patients and 47 controls (mean age: 70.9 \u00b1 4.8\u00a0years). All study subjects had a negative history for COVID-19. Sera were obtained after at least 21\u00a0days following the second vaccination. Anti-spike IgG antibody titers were measured quantitatively using a commercially available immunoassay method. Results: Patients with IMD were significantly less likely to have detectable antibodies than healthy controls both among the hospital workers (92.7% vs 99.7%, p < 0.001) and elderly population (77.3% vs 97.9%, p = 0.011). Among patients with IMD, those using immunosuppressive or immune-modulating drugs (64/75, 85.3%) were significantly less likely to have detectable antibodies compared to those off treatment (29/29, 100%) (p = 0.029). Additionally, a negative association between age and the antibody titer categories among patients (r = \u2212\u00a00.352; p < 0.001) and controls (r = \u2212\u00a00.258; p < 0.001) were demonstrated. Conclusions: Among hospital workers, the vast majority of patients with IMD and immunocompetent controls developed a significant humoral response following the administration of the second dose of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. This was also true for the elderly population, albeit with lower antibody titers. Immunosuppressive use, particularly rituximab significantly reduced antibody titers. Antibody titers were significantly lower among those aged \u2265 60\u00a0years both in patient and control populations. Whether these individuals should get a booster dose warrants further studies."

In a phase 1-2 trial involving healthy adults, the NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine had an acceptable safety profile and was associated with strong neutralizing-antibody and antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T-cell responses. Evaluation of vaccine efficacy was needed in a setting of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS In this phase 2a-b trial in South Africa, we randomly assigned human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative adults between the ages of 18 and 84 years or medically stable HIV-positive participants between the ages of 18 and 64 years in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of either the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine (5 $\\mu$g of recombinant spike protein with 50 $\\mu$g of Matrix-M1 adjuvant) or placebo. The primary end points were safety and vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 at 7 days or more after the second dose among participants without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS Of 6324 participants who underwent screening, 4387 received at least one injection of vaccine or placebo. Approximately 30% of the participants were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. Among 2684 baseline seronegative participants (94% HIV-negative and 6% HIV-positive), predominantly mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 15 participants in the vaccine group and in 29 in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 49.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1 to 72.8). Vaccine efficacy among HIV-negative participants was 60.1% (95% CI, 19.9 to 80.1). Of 41 sequenced isolates, 38 (92.7%) were the B.1.351 variant. Post hoc vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0% (95% CI, -0.6 to 76.2) among the HIV-negative participants. Preliminary local and systemic reactogenicity events were more common in the vaccine group; serious adverse events were rare in both groups. CONCLUSIONS The NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19, with higher vaccine efficacy observed among HIV-negative participants. Most infections were caused by the B.1.351 variant.

We here report vaccine-induced isolated carotid arterial thrombosis. METHODS: Imaging and laboratory findings, treatment decisions and outcome of this case are presented. RESULTS: Eight days after having received the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine, a 31-year-old man was admitted to our stroke unit with acute headache, aphasia, and hemiparesis. D-dimers were slightly elevated, but platelet count and fibrinogen level were normal. MRI-confirmed mainstem occlusion of middle cerebral artery resolved within 1 hour after start of IV thrombolysis. A wall-adherent, non-occluding thrombus in the ipsilateral carotid bulb was identified as the source of embolism. Cardiac or paradoxical (venous) embolism was excluded. Screening for presence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia-related antibodies was positive, and highly elevated serum IgG antibodies against PF4-polyanion complexes were subsequently proven. Treatment with aspirin and subcutaneous danaparoid, followed by phenprocoumon, led to thrombus shrinkage and dissolution within 19 days, and favorable clinical outcome. DISCUSSION: Vaccine history is important in patients not only with venous but also with arterial thromboembolic events. Vaccine-induced immune thrombosis of brain-supplying arteries may well be handled."

METHODS: Loss of sense of smell and/or taste was reported by 26 of 63 COVID-19 patients (41%), whereas only 31% of the patients experiencing hyposmia had simultaneous symptoms of rhinitis. Smell tests were performed in 14 of these patients and taste tests in 10. The measurements were conducted in a patient care setting in an early COVID-19 cohort.

To date, there have not been reports of sinus node dysfunction (SND) associated with COVID-19. This case series describes clinical characteristics, potential mechanisms, and short-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients who experience de novo SND. CASE SUMMARY: We present two cases of new-onset SND in patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient 1 is a 70-year-old female with no major past medical history who was intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia and developed new-onset sinus bradycardia without a compensatory increase in heart rate in response to relative hypotension. Patient 2 is an 81-year-old male with a past medical history of an ascending aortic aneurysm, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnoea who required intubation for COVID-19-induced acute hypoxic respiratory failure and exhibited new-onset sinus bradycardia followed by numerous episodes of haemodynamically significant accelerated idioventricular rhythm. Two weeks following the onset of SND, both patients remain in sinus bradycardia. DISCUSSION: COVID-19-associated SND has not previously been described. The potential mechanisms for SND in patients with COVID-19 include myocardial inflammation or direct viral infiltration. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 should be monitored closely for the development of bradyarrhythmia and haemodynamic instability."

Several studies from New York, Italy, and China confirm that patients with diabetes are at a much higher risk for mortality due to COVID-19. Besides respiratory illness, COVID-19 increases cardiac injury and diabetic ketoacidosis. In the absence of specific guidelines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 for patients with diabetes, they remain at higher risk and are more susceptible to COVID-19. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of basic knowledge on how diabetes affects pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In patients with diabetes, impaired glucose use alters metabolic and consequently biological processes instigating pathological remodeling, which has detrimental effects on cardiovascular systems. A majority of biological processes are regulated by noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs), which have emerged as a promising therapeutic candidate for several diseases. In consideration of the higher risk of mortality in patients with diabetes and COVID-19, novel diagnostic test and treatment strategy are urgently warranted in post-COVID-19 era. Here, we describe potential roles of miRNA as a biomarker and therapeutic candidate, especially for heart failure, in patients with diabetes and COVID-19."

Although the clinical spectrum of Covid-19 is variable, acute respiratory failure and systemic coagulopathy are common in severe Covid-19 patients. Lung is an important target of the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing eventually acute respiratory distress syndrome associated to a thromboinflammatory state. The cytokinic storm, thromboinflammation and pulmonary tropism are the bedrock of tissue lesions responsible for acute respiratory failure and for prolonged infection that may lead to multiple organ failure and death. The thrombogenicity of this infectious disease is illustrated by the high frequency of thromboembolic events observed even in Covid-19 patients treated with anticoagulation. Increased D-Dimers, a biomarker reflecting activation of hemostasis and fibrinolysis, and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) are associated with higher mortality in Covid-19 patients. In this review, we will summarize our current knowledge on the thromboembolic manifestations, the disturbed hemostatic parameters, and the thromboinflammatory conditions associated to Covid-19 and we will discuss the modalities of anticoagulant treatment or other potential antithrombotic options."

COVID-19 is the first coronavirus after Spanish Flu 1918-1919, who has extremely influenced the health system, economy, and psychology of India. The present study review is on the general continent, virology, pathogenesis, global epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and control of COVID-19 with the reference to India."

We have some room for improvement related to the unreadingess of healthcare facility and the major steps taken by the government. It is suggested that the country should have stricter Stay-at-Home notice, suppress the spread by imposing lockdown on a large scale, improve healthcare service, and increase the availability of personal protective equipments (PPE). It is important to avoid an epidemic peak that potentially overwhelms healthcare service by quarantining the case contacts. Lockdown may prolong the epidemic doubling time significantly. Demand of health system is likely to grow since the number of COVID-19 case is likely to rise. Effective procedures for protecting medical staff from infection are essential. Scientific research in Indonesia is also crucial to provide suggestion and recommendation pertinent to COVID-19."

The impact of this disease has, however, shown baffling variations in prevalence in different regions of the world. The aim of this short review is to identify differential national COVID-19 prevalence of COVID-19, as well as to suggest these epidemiological differences. Methods A review of studies was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar search engines. Search tactics were centered on COVID-19 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d AND \u201ccoronavirus\u201d) and BCG vaccination (\u201cBCG vaccination\u201d OR \u201cBacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin\u201d OR \u201cvaccine\u201d) Results It is found that national prevalence differences may be linked with BCG childhood immunization history. A statistically insignificant difference was observed in COVID-19 prevalence when comparing countries with a BGC policy and countries without it (P> 0.05). This inconclusivity suggests the influence of confounders in this study. Conclusions National differences in COVID-19 cases can be attributable to immunologic regulations, such as BCG vaccination protocols. Caution should be taken in establishing a correlation between COVID-19 prevalence and BCG vaccination, partly due to the weak quality of statistical data on COVID-19 related to poor testing rates in countries with BCG vaccination policy. Nonetheless, the analysis of the epidemiological aspects of COVID-19 will shed light on future efforts towards effective control and prevention."

Using an online survey, data were collected between late March and early April 2020. Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk and included 747 adults living in the United States. Supporting our hypotheses, results indicated that both COVID-19-related worries and social isolation were significant mediators of the relationship between PVC and TS (Model 1). In addition, the results of a moderated mediation analysis indicated that the indirect effect of PVC on TS through COVID-19-related worries was stronger for participants who reported greater social isolation (Model 2).

The race is on globally to repurpose drugs for COVID-19 and develop a safe and effective vaccine against the disease. There is an urgent need to search for effective remedies against COVID-19 from the rich and extensive flora of Africa and the world. A literature search was conducted to obtain information on drugs with the potential for effectiveness in the treatment of COVID-19 based mostly on outcomes of preclinical studies and a few clinical investigations. This was considered important to this perspective as some of the identified mechanisms of action may be related to potential anti-COVID-19 actions of phytomedicines. The findings from the literature search were also used to establish the need for exploration of phytomedicines in the fight against COVID-19. This perspective identifies the need to preserve the rich tradition of herbal medicine in Africa, repositioning it by inculcating all aspects of discovery, development, and chemical evaluation of pharmaceuticals from medicinal plants for effective management of prevalent diseases. The identified mechanisms of action of current drugs under consideration for the treatment of COVID-19 include preventing fusion of SARS-CoV-2 with human cells; decrease acidity in endosomes, cell membrane-derived vesicles for transportation of the virus within the host cell and within which the virus can replicate; and blockade of the production of proinflammatory cytokines.

Methods: We reviewed the risk of vertical transmission of COVID-19 to the fetus of infected mothers by using data of published articles or official websites up to March 4, 2020. Results: A total of 31 infected pregnant mothers with COVID-19 were reported. No COVID-19 infection was detected in their neonates or placentas. Two mothers died from COVID-19-related respiratory complications after delivery. Conclusions: Currently, based on limited data, there is no evidence for intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 from infected pregnant women to their fetuses. Mothers may be at increased risk for more severe respiratory complications."

Here, we discuss the important considerations for epilepsy patients by reviewing known facts of COVID-19 and suggestions from medical societies associated with epilepsy, as well as inferences from past experiences of infectious diseases. We discuss the risk of COVID-19 for epilepsy patients, the effect of COVID-19 on epilepsy patients, and the importance of maintaining seizure control.

        "context": "The novel Corona virus infection (Covid-19) first identified in China in December 2019 has rapidly progressed in pandemic leading to significant mortality and unprecedented challenge for healthcare systems. Although the clinical spectrum of Covid-19 is variable, acute respiratory failure and systemic coagulopathy are common in severe Covid-19 patients. Lung is an important target of the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing eventually acute respiratory distress syndrome associated to a thromboinflammatory state. The cytokinic storm, thromboinflammation and pulmonary tropism are the bedrock of tissue lesions responsible for acute respiratory failure and for prolonged infection that may lead to multiple organ failure and death. The thrombogenicity of this infectious disease is illustrated by the high frequency of thromboembolic events observed even in Covid-19 patients treated with anticoagulation. Increased D-Dimers, a biomarker reflecting activation of hemostasis and fibrinolysis, and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) are associated with higher mortality in Covid-19 patients. In this review, we will summarize our current knowledge on the thromboembolic manifestations, the disturbed hemostatic parameters, and the thromboinflammatory conditions associated to Covid-19 and we will discuss the modalities of anticoagulant treatment or other potential antithrombotic options."

Thus, cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management, stool viral tests, and virus exposure are major concerns in the context of COVID-19 epidemic. In patients with colorectal cancer and IBD, the colonic mucosa exhibits elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor levels, enhancing COVID-19 susceptibility. In some cases, positive viral stool tests may be the only indicator of infection at admission or after leaving quarantine. Without supplemental stool tests, the risk of undetected COVID-19 transmission is high. Moreover, viral exposure during the regular or emergency endoscopic examination should be avoided.

        "context": "Background: Adverse mental health consequences of COVID-19, including anxiety and depression, have been widely predicted but not yet accurately measured. There are a range of physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but it is not known if there are also psychiatric risk factors. Methods: We addressed both questions using cohort studies derived from an electronic health records (EHR) network of 69 million patients including over 62,000 cases of COVID-19. Propensity score matching was used to control for confounding by risk factors for COVID-19 and for more severe illness. Findings: In patients with no prior psychiatric history, COVID-19 was associated with an increased incidence of psychiatric diagnoses in the three months after infection compared to 6 other health events (hazard ratio [95% CI] 2.1 [1.8-2.5] compared to influenza; 1.7 [1.5-1.9] compared to other respiratory tract infections; 1.6 [1.4-1.9] compared to skin infection; 1.6 [1.3.1-9] compared to cholelithiasis; 2.2 [1.9-2.6] compared to urolithiasis, and 2.1 [1.9-2.5] compared to fracture of a large bone; all p<0.0001). The increase was greatest for anxiety disorders but also present for depression, insomnia, and dementia. The results were robust to several sensitivity analyses. There was a ~30% reduction in psychiatric diagnoses in the total EHR population over the same period. A psychiatric diagnosis in the previous year was associated with a 65% higher incidence of COVID-19 (relative risk 1.65, 95% CI: 1.59-1.71, p<0.0001). This was independent of known physical health risk factors for COVID-19. Interpretation: COVID-19 infection has both psychiatric sequelae and psychiatric antecedents. Survivors have an increased rate of new onset psychiatric disorders, and prior psychiatric disorders are associated with a higher risk of COVID-19. The findings have implications for research into aetiology and highlight the need for clinical services to provide multidisciplinary follow-up, and prompt detection and treatment."

This relates to the fitness of the immune system of the individual challenged by the virus. Patients with a reduced immune fitness can demonstrate a dysregulated NLRP3 inflammasome activity resulting in severe COVID-19 with tissue damage and a cytokine storm.

In the absence of efficient therapeutics or vaccines, control strategies are currently based on non-pharmaceutical interventions, comprising changes in population behavior and governmental interventions, among which the prohibition of mass gatherings, closure of non-essential establishments, quarantine and movement restrictions. In this work we analyzed the effects of 547 published governmental interventions, and population adherence thereof, on the dynamics of COVID-19 cases across all 27 Brazilian states, with emphasis on state capitals and remaining inland cities. A generalized SEIR model with a time-varying transmission rate (TR), that considers transmission by asymptomatic individuals, is presented. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were used to calibrate the model parameters using non-linear least squares methods. We analyze the changes on the TR and effective reproduction number as a function of both the extent of enforced measures across Brazilian states as well as population movement. The social mobility reduction index, a measure of population movement, together with the stringency index, adapted to incorporate the degree of restrictions imposed by governmental regulations, were used in conjunction to quantify and compare the effects of varying degrees of policy strictness across Brazilian states. Our results show that population adherence to social distance recommendations plays an important role for the effectiveness of interventions, and represents a major challenge to the control of COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries."

The questionnaire was adapted from a tool developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for risk assessment and management of exposure of healthcare workers in the context of COVID-19. Data were collected from the respondents online using Google forms. There was no significant difference in baseline information between COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative physicians. The physicians, who were unaware of direct participation in COVID-19 patient care, had higher odds of being COVID-19 positive (OR = 4.018; CI: 1.532\u201310.535). Additionally, the physicians, who were unaware of the COVID-19 status while performing the aerosol-generated procedure (AGP), had a higher chance of being COVID-19 positive (OR = 2.522; CI: 1.020\u20136.233).

Pharmacists are at the front line and have long been involved in combating this public health emergency. Therefore, the study was aimed to explore pharmacy preparedness and response to prevent and control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted in six pharmacies in Aksum, Ethiopia in May, 2020. We conducted six in-depth interviews with purposively selected key informants. Direct observation measures were made to assess the activities made in the medicine retail outlets for the prevention and control of the pandemic. Interview data were audio-recorded, translated and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the data and OpenCode version 4.02 software was used to facilitate the data analysis. RESULTS: The thematic analysis has resulted in seven major themes. Good preparedness measures were undertaken to control and prevent COVID-19. Study informants had good knowledge about the pandemic disease and reported they had used different resource materials to update themselves. Preparing of alcohol-based hand-rub, availing finished sanitizers and alcohol, and advising clients to maintain physical distancing were the major counseling information being delivered to prevent the disease. Some tendencies of irrational drug use and false claims of COVID-19 were observed at the beginning of the pandemic. Interview informants had reported they were working with relevant stakeholders and appropriate patient education and support were given to combat the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The study revealed necessary pharmacy services has been rendered to all clients. However, availability of drugs and medical supplies were scarce which negatively affected the optimal delivery of pharmacy services. The government and other responsible bodies should work together to solve such problems and contain the pandemic."

Understanding ocular manifestations of patients with COVID-19 by ophthalmologists and others may facilitate the diagnosis and prevention of transmission of the disease. Objective: To investigate ocular manifestations and viral prevalence in the conjunctiva of patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case series, patients with COVID-19 treated from February 9 to 15, 2020, at a hospital center in Hubei province, China, were retrospectively reviewed for ocular manifestations. During the period of treatment, the ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were noted and analyzed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Of the 38 included patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, 25 (65.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 65.8 (16.6) years. Among them, 28 patients (73.7%) had positive findings for COVID-19 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and of these, 2 patients (5.2%) yielded positive findings for SARS-CoV-2 in their conjunctival as well as nasopharyngeal specimens. A total of 12 of 38 patients (31.6%; 95% CI, 17.5-48.7) had ocular manifestations consistent with conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions. By univariate analysis, patients with ocular symptoms were more likely to have higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and higher levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase than patients without ocular symptoms. In addition, 11 of 12 patients with ocular abnormalities (91.7%; 95% CI, 61.5-99.8) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Of these, 2 (16.7%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from both conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, one-third of patients with COVID-19 had ocular abnormalities, which frequently occurred in patients with more severe COVID-19.

The majority of our COVID-19+ cases are mild, with only 8 of the 233 COVID-19+ cases having been hospitalized. Our results show that 43.4% of COVID-19+ cases have symptoms lasting longer than 30 days, and 24.1% still have at least one symptom after 90 days. These numbers are higher for COVID-19+ cases who were initially more ill, 59.4% at 30 days and 40.6% at 90 days, but even for very mild and initially asymptomatic cases, 14.3% have complications persist for 30 days or longer. In contrast, only 8.6% of participants from the general untested population develop new symptoms lasting longer than 30 days due to any illness during the same study period. The long-term symptoms most enriched in those with COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, difficulty concentrating, dyspnea, memory loss, confusion, headache, heart palpitations, chest pain, pain with deep breaths, dizziness, and tachycardia. We additionally observe that individuals who had an initial symptom of dyspnea are significantly more likely to develop long-term symptoms. Importantly, our study finds that the overall level of illness is an important variable to account for when assessing the statistical significance of symptoms that are associated with COVID-19. Our study provides a baseline from which to understand the frequency of COVID-19 long-term symptoms at the population level and demonstrates that, although those most likely to develop long-term COVID-19 complications are those who initially have more severe illness, even those with mild or asymptomatic courses of infection are at increased risk of long-term complications."

Mental health in patients with COVID-19 was also found to be adversely affected. The burden of caring for COVID-19 survivors is likely to be huge. Therefore, it is important for policy makers to develop comprehensive strategies in providing resources and capacity in the healthcare system. Future epidemiological studies are needed to further investigate the long-term impact on COVID-19 survivors."

        "context": "- Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) virus and resulting COVID\u201019 pandemic present important diagnostic challenges Several diagnostic strategies are available to identify current infection, rule out infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response Serology tests to detect the presence of antibodies to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 aim to identify previous SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, and may help to confirm the presence of current infection Objectives To assess the diagnostic accuracy of antibody tests to determine if a person presenting in the community or in primary or secondary care has SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, or has previously had SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, and the accuracy of antibody tests for use in seroprevalence surveys Search methods We undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID\u201019 Study Register and the COVID\u201019 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv In addition, we checked repositories of COVID\u201019 publications We did not apply any language restrictions We conducted searches for this review iteration up to 27 April 2020 Selection criteria We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated antibody tests (including enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, and lateral flow assays) in people suspected of current or previous SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection We also included studies of people either known to have, or not to have SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection We included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests (RT\u2010PCR) and clinical diagnostic criteria) Data collection and analysis We assessed possible bias and applicability of the studies using the QUADAS\u20102 tool We extracted 2x2 contingency table data and present sensitivity and specificity for each antibody (or combination of antibodies) using paired forest plots We pooled data using random\u2010effects logistic regression where appropriate, stratifying by time since post\u2010symptom onset We tabulated available data by test manufacturer We have presented uncertainty in estimates of sensitivity and specificity using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) Main results We included 57 publications reporting on a total of 54 study cohorts with 15,976 samples, of which 8526 were from cases of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection Studies were conducted in Asia (n = 38), Europe (n = 15), and the USA and China (n = 1) We identified data from 25 commercial tests and numerous in\u2010house assays, a small fraction of the 279 antibody assays listed by the Foundation for Innovative Diagnostics More than half (n = 28) of the studies included were only available as preprints We had concerns about risk of bias and applicability Common issues were use of multi\u2010group designs (n = 29), inclusion of only COVID\u201019 cases (n = 19), lack of blinding of the index test (n = 49) and reference standard (n = 29), differential verification (n = 22), and the lack of clarity about participant numbers, characteristics and study exclusions (n = 47) Most studies (n = 44) only included people hospitalised due to suspected or confirmed COVID\u201019 infection There were no studies exclusively in asymptomatic participants Two\u2010thirds of the studies (n = 33) defined COVID\u201019 cases based on RT\u2010PCR results alone, ignoring the potential for false\u2010negative RT\u2010PCR results We observed evidence of selective publication of study findings through omission of the identity of tests (n = 5) We observed substantial heterogeneity in sensitivities of IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies, or combinations thereof, for results aggregated across different time periods post\u2010symptom onset (range 0% to 100% for all target antibodies) We thus based the main results of the review on the 38 studies that tratified esults by time since symptom onset The numbers of individuals contributing data within each study each week are small and are usually not based on tracking the same groups of patients over time Pooled results for IgG, IgM, IgA, total antibodies and IgG/IgM all showed low sensitivity during the first week since onset of symptoms (all less than 30 1%), rising in the second week and reaching their highest values in the third week The combination of IgG/IgM had a sensitivity of 30 1% (95% CI 21 4 to 40 7) for 1 to 7 days, 72 2% (95% CI 63 5 to 79 5) for 8 to 14 days, 91 4% (95% CI 87 0 to 94 4) for 15 to 21 days Estimates of accuracy beyond three weeks are based on smaller sample sizes and fewer studies For 21 to 35 days, pooled sensitivities for IgG/IgM were 96 0% (95% CI 90 6 to 98 3) There are insufficient studies to estimate sensitivity of tests beyond 35 days post\u2010symptom onset Summary specificities (provided in 35 studies) exceeded 98% for all target antibodies with confidence intervals no more than 2 percentage points wide False\u2010positive results were more common where COVID\u201019 had been suspected and ruled out, but numbers were small and the difference was within the range expected by chance Assuming a prevalence of 50%, a value considered possible in healthcare workers who have suffered respiratory symptoms, we would anticipate that 43 (28 to 65) would be missed and 7 (3 to 14) would be falsely positive in 1000 people undergoing IgG/IgM testing at days 15 to 21 post\u2010symptom onset At a prevalence of 20%, a likely value in surveys in high\u2010risk settings, 17 (11 to 26) would be missed per 1000 people tested and 10 (5 to 22) would be falsely positive At a lower prevalence of 5%, a likely value in national surveys, 4 (3 to 7) would be missed per 1000 tested, and 12 (6 to 27) would be falsely positive Analyses showed small differences in sensitivity between assay type, but methodological concerns and sparse data prevent comparisons between test brands Authors' conclusions The sensitivity of antibody tests is too low in the first week since symptom onset to have a primary role for the diagnosis of COVID\u201019, but they may still have a role complementing other testing in individuals presenting later, when RT\u2010PCR tests are negative, or are not done Antibody tests are likely to have a useful role for detecting previous SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection if used 15 or more days after the onset of symptoms However, the duration of antibody rises is currently unknown, and we found very little data beyond 35 days post\u2010symptom onset We are therefore uncertain about the utility of these tests for seroprevalence surveys for public health management purposes Concerns about high risk of bias and applicability make it likely that the accuracy of tests when used in clinical care will be lower than reported in the included studies Sensitivity has mainly been evaluated in hospitalised patients, so it is unclear whether the tests are able to detect lower antibody levels likely seen with milder and asymptomatic COVID\u201019 disease The design, execution and reporting of studies of the accuracy of COVID\u201019 tests requires considerable improvement Studies must report data on sensitivity disaggregated by time since onset of symptoms COVID\u201019\u2010positive cases who are RT\u2010PCR\u2010negative should be included as well as those confirmed RT\u2010PCR, in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) and China National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (CDC) case definitions We were only able to obtain data from a small proportion of available tests, and action is needed to ensure that all results of test evaluations are available in the public domain to prevent selective reporting This is a fast\u2010moving field and we plan ongoing updates of this living systematic review Plain language summary What is the diagnostic accuracy of antibody tests for the detection of infection with the COVID\u201019 virus? Background COVID\u201019 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus that spreads ea ily betwee people in a similar way to the common cold or \u2018flu Most people with COVID\u201019 have a mild to moderate respiratory illness, and some may have no symptoms (asymptomatic infection) Others experience severe symptoms and need specialist treatment and intensive care The immune system of people who have COVID\u201019 responds to infection by developing proteins that can attack the virus (antibodies) in their blood Tests to detect antibodies in peoples' blood might show whether they currently have COVID\u201019 or have had it previously Why are accurate tests important? Accurate testing allows identification of people who might need treatment, or who need to isolate themselves to prevent the spread of infection Failure to detect people with COVID\u201019 when it is present (a false negative result) may delay treatment and risk further spread of infection to others Incorrect identification of COVID\u201019 when it is not present (a false positive result) may lead to unnecessary further testing, treatment, and isolation of the person and close contacts Correct identification of people who have previously had COVID\u201019 is important in measuring disease spread, assessing the success of public health interventions (like isolation), and potentially in identifying individuals with immunity (should antibodies in the future be shown to indicate immunity) To identify false negative and false positive results, antibody test results are compared in people known to have COVID\u201019 and known not to have COVID\u201019 Study participants are classified as to whether they are known or not known to have COVID\u201019 based on criteria known as the \u2018reference standard\u2019 Many studies use samples taken from the nose and throat to identify people with COVID\u201019 The samples undergo a testcalled reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) This testing process can sometimes miss infection (false negative result), but additional tests can identify COVID\u201019 infection in people with a negative RT\u2010PCR result These include measuring clinical symptoms, like coughing or high temperature, or \u2018imaging\u2019 tests like chest X\u2010rays People known not to have COVID\u201019 are sometimes identified from stored blood samples taken before COVID\u201019 existed, or from patients with respiratory symptoms found to be caused by other diseases What did the review study? The studies looked at three types of antibody, IgA, IgG and IgM Most tests measure both IgG and IgM, but some measure a single antibody or combinations of the three antibodies Levels of antibodies rise and fall at different times after infection IgG is the last to rise but lasts longest Levels of antibodies are usually highest a few weeks after infection Some antibody tests need specialist laboratory equipment Others use disposable devices, similar to pregnancy tests These tests can be used in laboratories or wherever the patient is (point\u2010of\u2010care), in hospital or at home We wanted to find out whether antibody tests: \u2010 are accurate enough to diagnose infection in people with or without symptoms of COVID\u201019, and \u2010 can be used to find out if someone has already had COVID\u201019 What did we do? We looked for studies that measured the accuracy of antibody tests compared with reference standard criteria to detect current or past COVID\u201019 infection Studies could assess any antibody test compared with any reference standard People could be tested in hospital or the community Studies could test people known to have \u2013 or not to have \u2013 or be suspected of having COVID\u201019 Study characteristics We found 54 relevant studies Studies took place in Asia (38), Europe (15), and in both USA and China (1) Forty\u2010six studies included people who were in hospital with suspected or confirmed COVID\u201019 infection only Twenty\u2010nine studies compared test results in people with COVID\u201019 with test results in healthy people or people with other diseases Not all studies provided details about participants\u2019 age and gender Often, we could not tell whether studies were valuating c rrent or past infection, as few reported whether participants were recovering We did not find any studies that tested only asymptomatic people Main results Our findings come mainly from 38 studies that provided results based on the time since people first noticed symptoms Antibody tests one week after first symptoms only detected 30% of people who had COVID\u201019 Accuracy increased in week 2 with 70% detected, and was highest in week 3 (more than 90% detected) Little evidence was available after week 3 Tests gave false positive results in 2% of those without COVID\u201019 Results from IgG/IgM tests three weeks after symptoms started suggested that if 1000 people had antibody tests, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID\u201019 (as we might expect in a national screening survey): \u2010 58 people would test positive for COVID\u201019 Of these, 12 people (21%) would not have COVID\u201019 (false positive result) \u2010 942 people would test negative for COVID\u201019 Of these, 4 people (0 4%) would actually have COVID\u201019 (false negative result) If we tested 1000 healthcare workers (in a high\u2010risk setting) who had had symptoms, and 500 (50%) of them really had COVID\u201019: \u2010 464 people would test positive for COVID\u201019 Of these, 7 people (2%) would not have COVID\u201019 (false positive result) \u2010 537 people would test negative for COVID\u201019 Of these, 43 (8%) would actually have COVID\u201019 (false negative result) We did not find convincing differences in accuracy for different types of antibody test How reliable were the results of the studies of this review? Our confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons In general, studies were small, did not use the most reliable methods and did not report their results fully Often, they did not include patients with COVID\u201019 who may have had a false negative result on PCR, and took their data for people without COVID\u201019 from records of tests done before COVID\u201019 arose This may have affected test accuracy, but it is impossible to identify by how much Who do the results of this review apply to? Most participants were in hospital with COVID\u201019, so were likely to have more severe disease than people with mild symptoms who were not hospitalised This means that we don't know how accurate antibody tests are for people with milder disease or no symptoms More than half of the studies assessed tests they had developed themselves, most of which are not available to buy Many studies were published quickly online as \u2018preprints\u2019 Preprints do not undergo the normal rigorous checks of published studies, so we are not certain how reliable they are As most studies took place in Asia, we don't know whether test results would be similar elsewhere in the world What are the implications of this review? The review shows that antibody tests could have a useful role in detecting if someone has had COVID\u201019, but the timing of when the tests are used is important Antibody tests may help to confirm COVID\u201019 infection in people who have had symptoms for more than two weeks and do not have a RT\u2010PCR test, or have negative RT\u2010PCR test results The tests are better at detecting COVID\u201019 in people two or more weeks after their symptoms started, but we do not know how well they work more than five weeks after symptoms started We do not know how well the tests work for people who have milder disease or no symptoms, because the studies in the review were mainly done in people who were in hospital In time, we will learn whether having previously had COVID\u201019 provides individuals with immunity to future infection Further research is needed into the use of antibody tests in people recovering from COVID\u201019 infection, and in people who have experienced mild symptoms or who never experienced symptoms How up\u2010to\u2010date is this review? This review includes evidence published up to 27 April 2020 Because a lot of new research is being published in this field, we will update this review frequently"

Nations are assessing ways to reopen businesses while trying to balance health care risks and economic fallouts. Strategies involving antibody testing have been proposed before phased reopening of the economy. Therefore, assessing the sensitivity and specificity of antibody tests for symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients remains paramount to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks. The antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 detect the presence of IgA, IgM, or IgG antibodies produced by B cells. There are four major types of antibody tests: rapid diagnostic tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, neutralization assays, and chemiluminescent immunoassays. Currently, there is no standard antibody test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during or after exposure or infection. The antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 have a low specificity within the first week of exposure and increase in the second and third weeks. The current data on antibody tests have several limitations in quality and the presence of bias. Specifically, many antibody tests have a high false-negative rate and a high risk of bias for participant selection, application of index tests, reference standard used, and flow and timing for antibody tests that may incorrectly report the accuracy of COVID-19 antibody tests. In this review, we summarize the current methods, sensitivity/specificity, and gaps in knowledge concerning COVID-19 antibody testing."

        "context": "Several immunochromatographic serological test kits have been developed to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies, but their relative performance and potential clinical utility is unclear. Three commercially available serological test kits were evaluated using 99 serum samples collected from 29 patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 100 serum samples collected from 100 healthy volunteers in 2017 as negative controls. Results The specificity of the IgM and IgG antibodies showed comparable results among the three immunochromatographic serological test kits. The specificity for IgM antibody was 98.0%, 98.0%, and 97.0%, and the specificity for IgG antibody was identical among the three kits (99.0%). The IgM antibody-positive rates of the three test kits for samples taken at the early stage of the disease (0\u20134 days after onset) were consistent with all three kits (18.2%); however, the IgM antibody-positive rates thereafter showed considerable differences among the kits, making it difficult to interpret the kinetics of IgM response against SARS-CoV-2. The IgG antibody-positive rates for samples taken after 13 days of onset were 100.0%, 97.6%, and 97.6%, respectively. Conclusion There were large differences among the results of the three test kits. Only few cases showed positive results for IgM, suggesting that at least 2 of these kits used in this study were unsuitable for diagnosis of COVID-19. The IgG antibody was positive in almost all samples after 13 days of onset, suggesting that it may be useful for determining infections in the recent past."

        "context": "We consider a novel method to increase the reliability of COVID-19 virus or antibody tests by using specially designed pooled testings. Instead of testing nasal swab or blood samples from individual persons, we propose to test mixtures of samples from many individuals. The pooled sample testing method proposed in this paper also serves a different purpose: for increasing test reliability and providing accurate diagnoses even if the tests themselves are not very accurate. Our method uses ideas from compressed sensing and error-correction coding to correct for a certain number of errors in the test results. The intuition is that when each individual's sample is part of many pooled sample mixtures, the test results from all of the sample mixtures contain redundant information about each individual's diagnosis, which can be exploited to automatically correct for wrong test results in exactly the same way that error correction codes correct errors introduced in noisy communication channels. While such redundancy can also be achieved by simply testing each individual's sample multiple times, we present simulations and theoretical arguments that show that our method is significantly more efficient in increasing diagnostic accuracy. In contrast to group testing and compressed sensing which aim to reduce the number of required tests, this proposed error correction code idea purposefully uses pooled testing to increase test accuracy, and works not only in the \"undersampling\" regime, but also in the \"oversampling\" regime, where the number of tests is bigger than the number of subjects. The results in this paper run against traditional beliefs that, \"even though pooled testing increased test capacity, pooled testings were less reliable than testing individuals separately.\""

Large-scale screening programs using antibody tests are currently under evaluation by different governments. Recently, a test for the rapid detection of combined IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human blood, serum/plasma has become available.6 As soon as the kits were commercially available, we assessed the reliability and usefulness of the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Antibody Rapid Test Kit (Beijing Diagreat Biotechnologies Co., Ltd) in patients with confirmed Covid 19 and in a small sample of patients with suspected disease, who were screened to be admitted to either a Covid 19 Unit or to a non Covid 19 ward."

A review of the literature available for the period leading up to and including June 2020 on the reliability of SARS-Cov-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) detection methods using real-time RT PCR (Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction) brings together the primary factors teams of scientists claim or demonstrate to affect the reliability of results. A description is given of the RT-PCR testing method, followed by a presentation of the characteristics and validation techniques used. A summary of data from the literature on the reliability of tests and commercial kits for SARS-Cov-2 detection, including current uncertainties with regard to the molecular targets selected and genetic diversity of SARS-Cov-2 is provided. The limitations and perspectives are then discussed in detail in the light of the bibliographic data available. Many questions have been asked that still remain unanswered.

SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus belonging to the subgenus Sarbecovirus. The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the thousands of deaths caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) led the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on 12 March 2020.

On 30. January 2020, the WHO Emergency Committee declared a global health emergency based on growing case notification rates at Chinese and international locations. The case detection rate is changing daily and can be tracked in almost real time on the website provided by Johns Hopkins University 1 and other forums. As of midst of February 2020, China bears the large burden of morbidity and mortality, whereas the incidence in other Asian countries, in Europe and North America remains low so far. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive single\u2010stranded large RNA viruses that infect humans, but also a wide range of animals. Coronaviruses were first described in 1966 by Tyrell and Bynoe, who cultivated the viruses from patients with common colds 2. Based on their morphology as spherical virions with a core shell and surface projections resembling a solar corona, they were termed coronaviruses (Latin: corona = crown). Four subfamilies, namely alpha\u2010, beta\u2010, gamma\u2010 and delta\u2010coronaviruses exist. While alpha\u2010 and beta\u2010coronaviruses apparently originate from mammals, in particular from bats, gamma\u2010 and delta\u2010viruses originate from pigs and birds. The genome size varies between 26 kb and 32 kb. Among the seven subtypes of coronaviruses that can infect humans, the beta\u2010coronaviruses may cause severe disease and fatalities, whereas alpha\u2010coronaviruses cause asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 belongs to the B lineage of the beta\u2010coronaviruses and is closely related to the SARS\u2010CoV virus 3, 4. The major four structural genes encode the nucleocapsid protein (N), the spike protein (S), a small membrane protein (SM) and the membrane glycoprotein (M) with an additional membrane glycoprotein (HE) occurring in the HCoV\u2010OC43 and HKU1 beta\u2010coronaviruses 5.

The results suggest that diabetes might be the most consistent comorbidity predicting disease severity and that future research should carefully consider the comparability of reporting cases, factors, and outcomes along the different stages of the natural history of covid-19"

        "context": "Since late December 2019 a new epidemic outbreak has emerged from Whuhan, China. Rapidly the new coronavirus has spread worldwide. China CDC has reported results of a descriptive exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed until the 11th February 2020, presenting the epidemiologic curves and geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 along with case fatality rate according to some baseline characteristics, such as age, gender and several well-established high prevalence comorbidities. Despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender. Besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics. We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, where 60 or older patients have an OR = 18.8161 (CI95%[7.1997; 41.5517]). Regarding comorbidities, cardiovascular disease appears to be the riskiest (OR= 12.8328 CI95%[10.2736; 15.8643], along with chronic respiratory disease (OR=7.7925 CI95%[5.5446; 10.4319]). Males are more likely to die from COVID-19 (OR=1.8518 (CI95%[1.5996; 2.1270]). Some limitations such as the lack of information about the correct prevalence of gender per age or about comorbidities per age and gender or the assumption of independence between risk factors are expected to have a small impact on results. A final point of paramount importance is that the equation presented here can be used to determine the probability of dying from COVID-19 for a particular patient, given its age interval, gender and comorbidities associated."

Since there is neither a vaccine nor a drug for Covid-19, people with an increased risk for severe and fatal courses of disease particularly need protection. Furthermore, factors increasing these risks are of interest in the search of potential treatments. A systematic literature review on the risk factors of severe and fatal Covid-19 courses is presented. Methods The review is carried out on PubMed and a publicly available preprint dataset. For analysis, risk factors are categorized and information regarding the study such as study size and location are extracted. The results are compared to risk factors listed by four public authorities from different countries. Results The 28 records included, eleven of which are preprints, indicate that conditions and comorbidities connected to a poor state of health such as high age, obesity, diabetes and hypertension are risk factors for severe and fatal disease courses. Furthermore, severe and fatal courses are associated with organ damages mainly affecting the heart, liver and kidneys. Coagulation dysfunctions could play a critical role in the organ damaging. Time to hospital admission, tuberculosis, inflammation disorders and coagulation dysfunctions are identified as risk factors found in the review but not mentioned by the public authorities. Conclusion Factors associated with increased risk of severe or fatal disease courses were identified, which include conditions connected with a poor state of health as well as organ damages and coagulation dysfunctions. The results may facilitate upcoming Covid-19 research."

        "context": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is ~5 days (ranging from 2 to 14 days), and people who develop symptoms do so within ~12 days of infection (ranging from 8 to 16 days) (1). A sizable portion of person-to-person virus transmission may occur before infected individuals develop symptoms (presymptomatics) (2). A fraction of infected individuals never develop symptoms (asymptomatics) yet may contribute substantially to disease transmission (3). Nucleic acid tests (NATs) can diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection and are typically used after the onset of symptoms. The kinetics and sensitivity of testing among asymptomatic people remain uncharacterized. The recovery period for mild cases of COVID-19 is ~2 weeks and that for severe cases is ~6 weeks. In the most severe cases, the time from symptom onset to death ranges between 2 and 8 weeks. Large-scale diagnostic testing is a key tool in epidemiology and in containing outbreaks such as COVID-19. Among other measures, aggressive testing might have helped restrain the coronavirus in the United States as it did in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Technical uncertainties in testing, initial regulatory hurdles, limited resources, and disruptions to supply chains permitted the spread of the virus worldwide. These challenges may be more pronounced in low- and middle-income countries. This Perspective addresses some of the key concerns regarding diagnostics that have arisen during the recent COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 tests can be grouped as nucleic acid, serological, antigen, and ancillary tests, all of which play distinct roles in hospital, point-of-care, or large-scale population testing. Table 1 summarizes the existing and emerging tests, current at the time of writing (May 2020). A continuously updated version of this table is available at https://csb.mgh.harvard.edu/covid. In NATs, viral RNA is reverse-transcribed into DNA, which is then amplified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). NATs are the most widely used tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and are increasingly run on automated platforms that take several hours to complete (4). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recommended distinct SARS-CoV-2\u2013specific RNA regions for testing (viral nucleocapsid N1, N2, and human RNase P gene), primers, and reagents (5). This assay differs from the World Health Organization (WHO) assay, which targets the CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and envelope (E) genes (6). By May 2020, more than 100 U.S. public health laboratories had completed the CDC's verification process and started offering NATs. These assays, including those from cleared commercial vendors, have high analytic sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 if sample acquisition, preparation, and device operation are carried out by trained personnel."
